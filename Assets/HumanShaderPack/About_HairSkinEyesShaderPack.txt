If you are using Amplify Shader Editor to rework these shaders.

Please Use the following shaders as a base as they have been reorgananised for this purpose with the 
main node features and finctions where available.

HairShader2_AS_RRF_Mod1
EyeShader_Model3
AdvancedSkinShader_Mar19_A

All of the other graphs are developmental and still need a cleanup/refinement pass. (date: 9th March 2019)

Known issues: Depth of field will not work correctly unless material Render Queue (at the bottom of each material) is set to transparent, however, due to 
this new sorting order it will not recieve ambient occlusion. It can only be one or the other due to the rendering limitations of current hardware and 
unity's current rendering queue methods. To enable Ambient occlusion change the Rnder Queue back to from Shader or other on a per-material basis. You can 
use your own custom methods to get the best visual look, for example, things that are in focus could use the Ambient Occlusion (render queue not 'transparent')
and if you want those to inherit Deoth of field you can switch those in runtime to 'transparent' . 
Here is the Enum details for the Rendering Queue: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderQueue.html
EXAMPLE:
In the example scene 'HumanShaderSetup', you will see that the three heads on the right' materials are using 'From Shader' allowing them to recieve Amobient Occulsion, but not depth of field.
